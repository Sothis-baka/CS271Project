To run the BnB portion of this code run it in terminal. Once the program is running it will ask you for an input source which will be a
generated problem in the same format as any of the files generated from generate_travelling_salesman_problem.py. Make sure the location you read
from is correct. If a valid problem is given it will ask if you want to run it in automated or not. If automated it will pick up to 10 cities as
starting point and calculate some general statistics to estimate how well it performed. This will take a long time depending on input size. In the
none autumated version you will be able to pick your own starting point and it will return the path between cities along with the cost.
